# Feedreader testing project

## What is this?
This is a project to learn unit testing by practice.

We are given a feedreader app that uses Google API and allows the user to choose among 4 feed to read (Udaciy Blog, CSS Tricks, HTML5 Rocks, Linear Digression).

There are 21 tasks to complete: you can find them in [TODO.md](https://github.com/davide2894/fend-feedreader/blob/master/TODO.md)

The goal is to complete all taks by using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) - an intuitive, JavaScript testing library.

## Get started
To run the application:
* click on "Clone or Download" (green button on the right)
* click "Download ZIP"
* once download is finished, unzip it
* from your browser: 
	* press Ctrl + O
	* navigate to project folder
	* select `index.html` file to open it

## Contribute
If you want to implement more tests to the project:
* fork this repository
* from your terminal, navigate to your project folder (ex: desktop/code), and type this:

``` 
git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git
```
* review [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io)
* use `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` to implement new tests
